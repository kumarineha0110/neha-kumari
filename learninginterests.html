  <p><h1>SOME OF MY LEARNING INTERESTS ARE:</h1></p><br><br>
     <H2>  <p> ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2> </p>
      <h3>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.
Research associated with artificial iIn computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".. </h3>
    <p> <h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT </h2> </p>
    <h3>Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</h3>
    <p><h2> PROGRAMMING </p></H2>
    <h3>Competitive programming is solving well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified limits.Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). </h3>
